# Web Audio Visualisation of Ten Million Fireflies

This is an audio visualiser of the song [Fireflies by Owl City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4) made using the [web audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API). It draws fireflies to a HTML canvas that get faster as the music gets louder, and slower as the music is quieter.
